# EcoNetwork_public

This repository gathers code I wrote for my Master 2 internship about the inference of co-occurrence networks.

* `functions/` folder contains all custom functions written for data treatment.
* `data/` folder contains modified data (for confidentiality purposes, this is not the original data from [Snapshot Safari](https://www.zooniverse.org/organizations/meredithspalmer/snapshot-safari)).
* `multiscale_inference/` folder contains the code to infer networks and a sample PDF report and networks generated from the sample data.
* `clustering/` folder contains the code and a PDF report to define sites clusters and synthetic habitat covariates (modified data).
* `low_abundances/` folder contains the code to run simulations of PLN performances with low vs high abundances and a PDF report.
* `null_model/` contains the code used to evaluate the inferred networks against a null model with a sample code run on modified data.
* `packrat/` contains the packages tracked by packrat used for these analyses.
