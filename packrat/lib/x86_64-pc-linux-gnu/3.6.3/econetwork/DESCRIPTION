Description: A collection of advanced tools, methods and models
    specifically designed for analyzing different types of ecological
    networks - especially antagonistic (food webs, host-parasite),
    mutualistic (plant-pollinator, plant-fungus, etc) and competitive
    networks, as well as their variability in time and space.
    Statistical models are developed to describe and understand the
    mechanisms that determine species interactions, and to decipher the
    organization of these (multi-layer) ecological networks.
Imports: stats, igraph, rdiversity, Matrix.utils, blockmodels,
