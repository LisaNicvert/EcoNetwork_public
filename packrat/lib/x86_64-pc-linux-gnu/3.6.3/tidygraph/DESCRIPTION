Description: A graph, while not "tidy" in itself, can be thought of as
    two tidy data frames describing node and edge data respectively.
    'tidygraph' provides an approach to manipulate these two virtual
    data frames using the API defined in the 'dplyr' package, as well
    as provides tidy interfaces to a lot of common graph algorithms.
